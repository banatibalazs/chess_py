> in my static method the self.update_board() is referring to an instance ?

---

Yes, in the context of the `update_board_after` static method in your `Board` class, `self.update_board()` is indeed referring to an instance method of the class. 

However, this is not typical usage of a static method. Static methods, by definition, don't have access to any instance or class-specific data or methods. They work with the arguments that are passed to them and don't modify the state of the instance or the class.

In your case, the `wrapper` function inside the `update_board_after` static method is a closure that captures the `self` variable from the surrounding scope. This allows it to call `self.update_board()`, even though `update_board_after` is a static method.

Here's the relevant part of your code:

```python
@staticmethod
def update_board_after(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.update_board()
        return result
    return wrapper
```

In this code, `wrapper` is a function that takes `self` as its first argument. When you use `update_board_after` as a decorator on an instance method, Python passes the instance of the class (i.e., `self`) as the first argument to `wrapper`. This is why `wrapper` can call `self.update_board()`.

To create a new array of tuples from two arrays, you can use the `numpy.dstack()` function followed by `numpy.reshape()`. Here is an example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two 1xn numpy arrays
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Stack the arrays along a third dimension
stacked_array = np.dstack((array1, array2))

# Reshape the stacked array to create an array of tuples
array_of_tuples = stacked_array.reshape(-1, 2)

print("Array of tuples:\n", array_of_tuples)
```

In this example, `array1` and `array2` are 1-dimensional arrays. The `numpy.dstack()` function stacks them along a third dimension, creating a 3-dimensional array. The `numpy.reshape()` function then reshapes this array into a 2-dimensional array of tuples. Each tuple contains one value from `array1` and one value from `array2`.

No, a `classmethod` is not a `staticmethod` in Python. They serve different purposes and are used differently.

A `classmethod` is a method that's bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It can access and modify class state. It has the class as its first argument. Here's an example:

```python
class MyClass:
    _class_var = 0

    @classmethod
    def modify_class_var(cls, new_value):
        cls._class_var = new_value
```

A `staticmethod`, on the other hand, can't access or modify class state. It works like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. It doesn't take a `self` or a `cls` parameter. Here's an example:

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method(arg1, arg2):
        return arg1 + arg2
```

So while both `classmethod` and `staticmethod` are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of a class, they have different behaviors and use cases.

The `has_piece_at` method in the `Player` class currently uses a for loop to iterate over all the pieces and checks if any of them are at the given coordinates. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of pieces.

One way to optimize this method is to maintain a set of coordinates for all the pieces. This set can be updated whenever a piece is moved or removed. Checking if a piece is at a given coordinate would then simply involve checking if the coordinate is in the set, which has a time complexity of O(1).

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name: str, color: ColorEnum):
        # ...
        self._piece_coordinates = set((piece.x, piece.y) for piece in self._pieces)

    def has_piece_at(self, x, y):
        return (x, y) in self._piece_coordinates

    def make_normal_move(self, to_x, to_y) -> None:
        # ...
        self._piece_coordinates.remove((self.selected_piece.x, self.selected_piece.y))
        self._piece_coordinates.add((to_x, to_y))
        self.selected_piece.set_coordinates(to_x, to_y)
        # ...

    def remove_piece_at(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        for piece in self._pieces:
            if piece.coordinates == (x, y):
                self._pieces.remove(piece)
                self._piece_coordinates.remove((x, y))
                break
```

In this code, `_piece_coordinates` is a set that stores the coordinates of all the pieces. The `has_piece_at` method checks if the given coordinate is in this set. The `make_normal_move` and `remove_piece_at` methods are updated to maintain this set whenever a piece is moved or removed.
