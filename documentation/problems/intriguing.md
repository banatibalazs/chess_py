> in my static method the self.update_board() is referring to an instance ?

---

Yes, in the context of the `update_board_after` static method in your `Board` class, `self.update_board()` is indeed referring to an instance method of the class. 

However, this is not typical usage of a static method. Static methods, by definition, don't have access to any instance or class-specific data or methods. They work with the arguments that are passed to them and don't modify the state of the instance or the class.

In your case, the `wrapper` function inside the `update_board_after` static method is a closure that captures the `self` variable from the surrounding scope. This allows it to call `self.update_board()`, even though `update_board_after` is a static method.

Here's the relevant part of your code:

```python
@staticmethod
def update_board_after(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.update_board()
        return result
    return wrapper
```

In this code, `wrapper` is a function that takes `self` as its first argument. When you use `update_board_after` as a decorator on an instance method, Python passes the instance of the class (i.e., `self`) as the first argument to `wrapper`. This is why `wrapper` can call `self.update_board()`.
